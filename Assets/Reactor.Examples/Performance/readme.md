# Performance Example

In this scene demonstrates createing 5 thousand beings which is added 3 components. 
After that, the entities in each frame are processed by the systems 
that add and remove components, resulting in constant switching between systems and groups.

It is worth noting that in reality the scenario in which
thousands of entities each frame will be added or removed
components is unlikely.
