# Custom Game Object Handling Example

This is very much like the simple movement example however rather than using the built in view conventions and resolvers you are now ignoring that and using your own.

This covers:
- Ignoring the view conventions
- Handling game objects in components without using view resolvers

For most people the existing view resolver approach is more than enough and will be used, however for those who want to know more or work outside of that paradigm this shows a way to do so.
