# Reactor

ECS framework - inspired by [EcsRx](https://github.com/EcsRx/ecsrx.unity) (EcsRx is really cool!) Designed for their needs, therefore suffers from a lack of documentation. But you can use the documentation from EcsRx or ask me a question. There are also examples in the project.

This framework is a bit different from the EcsRx. The main advantage of my implementation is performance. 

This implementation will increase performance by at least 2-x times. You can compare the performance of independently comparing PooledViews examples.

Another feature of the framework is a redesigned entity editor. Also added a bluprint editor. You can create a prototype, and on the basis of the prototype to create a blueprint. Codegen of blueprints slightly buggy. Maybe I'll fix it later.
